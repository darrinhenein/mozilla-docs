<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Loop is a product that leverages WebRTC technology to allow for <em>instant and easy communication</em> across various browsers and devices. Basic usage would be anonymous and link-driven, and a <strong>Firefox Account</strong> would enable a richer experience.</p>
<p>Beyond the initial video chat experience, this technology could enable a host of innovative communication channels, such as cross platform messaging, co-browsing and sharing of web experiences, or file sharing.</p>
<h5 id="why-mozilla-">Why Mozilla?</h5>
<p>By building Loop, Mozilla is in a unique place to provide the product our users deserve. Loop will enable our exising Firefox desktop audience (and over time, our Firefox mobile and Firefox OS audiences) to communicate, share, collaborate and coordinate in real-time on a platform built on the open web.</p>
